# Print is a function

# * is an operator recongized by python.
# 10 is an integer rcognized by python.

	# Naming and using variables page 21 / 54

	# Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.
	# They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number.
	# For instance, you can call a variable message_1 but not 1_message.

	# Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used
	# to separate words in variable names. For example, greeting_message works,
	# but greeting message will cause errors.

	# Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names;
	# that is, do not use words that Python has reserved for a particular pro-
	# grammatic purpose, such as the word print . (See “Python Keywords
	# and Built-in Functions” on page 489.)

	# Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, name is
	# better than n, student_name is better than s_n, and name_length is better
	# than length_of_persons_name.

	# Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O
	# because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.
